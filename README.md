# auto_renamer_forworldpeaceorsomething

*wtf is a spyecksfamily? i want one.*

Alrighty comrade,
Needs Python (min v2) installed on the target machine.

**Designed to auto rename multiple files in a specific folder.**

**How to use?**
Ah yes my sweet and curious summer child, let me teach ya:

**STEP 1:** ~~SECURE THE KEYS!!!!~~
Enter folder path. Just ctrl c + ctrl v innit?
**STEP 2:**
Then an integer value, this is what the first file would have.
* note that numbering is hardcoded in 3 digit format ie. 001 002 003 so on. Fun stuff
**STEP 3:**
Then file format. (this is necessary as it removes the old extension, so make note of that before you get your feet wet) Advanced research has shown that PNG better. So use PNG. End of discussion. Oh yeah enter it in lowercase ie. png or jpeg or mp4 or mp3 etc. (without the .)
**STEP 4:**
Then you can also add in some extra text after the numbers, this is optional. 0 if you don't want to; 1 if you do.
**STEP 5: (optional)**
Enter the extra text. This can start with _ (underscore) and can support . (period) Like _Mission11.5 etc.




Pretty cool, innit bruv????
